# E-Commerce Back End

In this project I created the back end of an e-commerce site using Express.js, Sequelize and MySql. I was given the task of a manager at an internet retail company build the back end for the company's e-commerce webpage using the latest technologies so the company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

In the back end I connected to the database using Sequilize then create a e_commerce database and seeded it with the test data. I then start my server and Sequilize my models to the MySQL database. I used Insomnia GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to test for categories, products and tags. Doing this I am able to create, update, and delete data in my database.
